# Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition

Predicting the classification of handwritten digits for Kaggle. The script evaluates several machine learning algorithms against a subsample of the data set, eventually showing that k-neighbors classification showed the highest accuracy rating compared to other algorithms available in scikit-learn.

Model params for the algorithm are optimized via gridsearch prior to training the model against the entire test set of data.

Kaggle Score: 97.186%
